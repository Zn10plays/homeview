## Inspiration
As a person who likes traveling and has been to multiple different countries, one of the biggest issues in traveling has been the housing. Home images on listings often seem bigger or brighter in pictures, but the reality is often disappointing. Our inspiration comes from real life experience, which is why we wanted to make an website that allows travelers, renters, and homebuyers the ability to explore properties in a more accurate and immersive way, ensuring that what they see is truly what they get. 

## What it does
_Homeview_ is a platform that allows users to explore real estate properties through immersive 3D models. By offering accurate, detailed models, _HomeView_ ensures that buyers, renters, and travelers can view homes as if they were physically there. This helps users make more informed decisions, eliminating the discrepancies between online images and the actual property.
## How we built it

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into challenges such as :
-**Performance issues**, compiling and running the program, often resulted in structures taking too long to generate. 
-**Complex coding and debugging.**
-**Compatibility across platforms**, working across multiple devices and platforms is challenging.
-**Resource constraints**, time and budget made it hard to execute the desired effects.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Since it's our first time interacting with motion to structure, we are proud of what we have created. 
## What we learned
We learned about motion to structure, C++, and transpiling code to python. 
## What's next for HomeView
